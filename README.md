# Full-Stack Fitness App

This full-stack fitness application was developed collaboratively during the Google Tech Exchange program. Our team designed, built, and deployed a robust fitness platform leveraging **Python, Streamlit, Docker, BigQuery, and Google Cloud Run**. The project supports features like meal logging, nutrition tracking, workout streaks, and user achievements. We followed Agile methodology and integrated CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive testing strategies.

## Key Features
- Full-stack web app with **Streamlit frontend** and Python backend.
- Docker containerization, BigQuery database, and Cloud Run hosting.
- CI/CD pipelines configured with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- Supports meal logging, nutrition tracking, calorie goals, and performance analytics.
- User achievements including streaks and badges for workout consistency and milestones.
- Utilized GenAI tools (Gemini, Vertex AI) for code generation, debugging, documentation, and UI prototyping.

## My Role in the Team
As part of a team of four, I contributed to key features and development phases:
- Designed and implemented backend logic for meal logging and nutrient tracking.
- Developed **Streamlit UI** for daily meal logging and macronutrient input.
- Added functionality for setting and tracking calorie goals.
- Implemented `get_user_posts()` and `get_user_profile()` functions with corresponding tests.
- Refactored and optimized tests with mocking and dependency injection.
- Designed paper prototypes for Feature 2, conducted usability testing, and integrated feedback.
- Wrote unit tests for frontend meal logging and UI interactions.

## Deployment
The application is deployed and accessible [here](https://my-streamlit-service-lpv2tbxtqq-uc.a.run.app/).

Developed as part of the Google Tech Exchange program.
