Feature 1: Workout Streaks & Achievements System

• Track consecutive days of workouts
• Award virtual badges/achievements for:
  - Distance milestones (e.g., first 5K, 10K, etc.)
  - Workout frequency (e.g., 7-day streak, 30-day streak)
  - Personal bests (e.g., fastest mile, longest workout)
  - Social engagement (e.g., first shared post, 10 community interactions)
• Display achievements on user profile

Difficulty: Medium (requires new database tables, achievement logic, and UI components)
